# Course 4: Algorithms on Strings

I decided to solve challenges using C#.
So I have to initialize a .NET Console project to make the LSP work properly in each assignment
So the file structure is a bit messy.
Starter files and test files can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs/programming/AUd0k/programming-assignment-1-decomposition-of-graphs)

NOTE: We also have to use C# version 7.0
Example how to run input file and expected output file compare to our program output in the `/tests` dir

```bash
# explain:
# diff <(command1) <(command2): compare output (write to stdout) of command1 and command2
# dotnet run < tests/02: pass file `02` as input to `dotnet run`
# cat tests/02.a: print content of `02.a`
diff <(dotnet run <tests/02) <(cat tests/02.a)
```
