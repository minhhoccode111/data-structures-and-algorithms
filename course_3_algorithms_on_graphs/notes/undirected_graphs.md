# Undirected graphs

**Definition**

A graph is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that each connect a pair of vertices

A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges

A simple path is one with no repeated vertices

A cycle is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same

A simple cycle is a cycle with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices)

The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges

A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph.

A graph that is not connected consists of a set of connected components, which are maximal connected subgraphs.

A tree is an acyclic connected graph.

A disjoint set of trees is called a forest.

A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all of that graph’s vertices and is a single tree.

A spanning forest of a graph is the union of spanning trees of its connected components.
