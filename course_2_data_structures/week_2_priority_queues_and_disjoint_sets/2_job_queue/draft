Job Queue Pseudocode

- Read Input
	 Read the number of workers (N) and the number of jobs (M)
	 Read the duration of each job (M integers)
- Initialize
	 Create an array to store the assigned worker for each job
	 Create an array to store the start time for each job
	 Create an array to store the next free time for each worker

create min-heap priority queue of every process to solve this problem

the min-heap start with every process wait time to 0
and the default index of each process will be the priority of that process
(because wait time is 0)

we loop through each job
- print process index and process wait time of the top item in the min-heap
- we add current job execute time to the process wait time of the top item
- sift down that top item in the min-heap
- repeat
