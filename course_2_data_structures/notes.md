# Data Structures Course

I decided to solve challenges using C#.
So I have to initialize a .NET Console project to make the LSP work properly in each assignment
So the file structure is a bit messy.
Starter files and test files can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/resources/N1p44)

NOTE: We also have to use C# version 7.0

Example how to run input file and expected output file compare to our program output in the `/tests` dir

```bash
diff <(dotnet run <tests/02) <(cat tests/02.a)
```
