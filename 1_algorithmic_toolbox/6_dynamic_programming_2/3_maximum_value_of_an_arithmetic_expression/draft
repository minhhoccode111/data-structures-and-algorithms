The key is to try all possible ways to split the expression and find the maximum value possible.

Pseudo Code

```
Function MaximizeExpression(expression):
    # First, separate numbers and operators into two arrays
    numbers = extract all numbers from expression
    operators = extract all operators from expression
    n = length of numbers array
    
    # Create two DP tables: one for maximum values and one for minimum values
    # We need minimum values because when multiplying by negatives, min can become max
    dp_max[n][n] = initialize 2D table filled with negative infinity
    dp_min[n][n] = initialize 2D table filled with positive infinity
    
    # Initialize the diagonal with single numbers
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        dp_max[i][i] = numbers[i]
        dp_min[i][i] = numbers[i]
    
    # Fill the DP tables
    for length from 2 to n:
        for i from 0 to n-length:
            j = i + length - 1
            
            # Try all possible splits between i and j
            for k from i to j-1:
                # Get the operator between positions k and k+1
                current_op = operators[k]
                
                # Calculate all possible combinations of min and max
                # from left and right subexpressions
                left_max = dp_max[i][k]
                left_min = dp_min[i][k]
                right_max = dp_max[k+1][j]
                right_min = dp_min[k+1][j]
                
                # Calculate all possible values based on the operator
                if current_op is '+':
                    dp_max[i][j] = max(dp_max[i][j], left_max + right_max)
                    dp_min[i][j] = min(dp_min[i][j], left_min + right_min)
                
                else if current_op is '-':
                    dp_max[i][j] = max(dp_max[i][j], left_max - right_min)
                    dp_min[i][j] = min(dp_min[i][j], left_min - right_max)
                
                else if current_op is '*':
                    # Need to consider all combinations due to negative numbers
                    values = [
                        left_max * right_max,
                        left_max * right_min,
                        left_min * right_max,
                        left_min * right_min
                    ]
                    dp_max[i][j] = max(dp_max[i][j], maximum of values)
                    dp_min[i][j] = min(dp_min[i][j], minimum of values)
    
    # Return the maximum value possible for the entire expression
    return dp_max[0][n-1]
```

The key ideas in this solution are:

1. We need two DP tables (max and min) because when dealing with multiplication and negative numbers, a minimum value in a subexpression could lead to the maximum value in the final result.

2. For each length of subexpression and each starting position, we try every possible split point and operator.

3. For each operator (+, -, *), we need to consider different combinations of max and min values from the left and right subexpressions.

4. The final answer will be in dp_max[0][n-1], representing the maximum value possible for the entire expression.

For the example in the exercise (5-8+7×4-8+9), this algorithm would find that the maximum value is 200, achieved by the parenthesization: 5 - ((8+7) × (4-(8+9))).
